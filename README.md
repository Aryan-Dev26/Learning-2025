# Learning-2025

This repository contains Python programs I wrote today (25-08-2025) while learning loops and basic algorithm exercises.  

üåÄ Loops Practice

While Loops
- `loops_while.py` ‚Äì Basic while loop examples  
- `Multiplication_Table_While.py` ‚Äì Multiplication table using while loop  
- `Searching_While.py` ‚Äì Searching elements with while loop  
- `Square_While.py` ‚Äì Print squares using while loop  
- `Traverse_While.py` ‚Äì Traverse lists using while loop  
- `N_Num_Sum_While_loop.py` ‚Äì Sum of N numbers using while loop  

For Loops
- `Print_Searching_For.py` ‚Äì Search using for loop  
- `Range_Print_Multiplication.py` ‚Äì Print multiplication table using for loop  
- `Factorial_For.py` ‚Äì Factorial calculation using for loop  

‚úÖ How to Run
- Python programs: `python filename.py` in your terminal  
- Each file demonstrates a specific concept related to loops  

üìù Notes
- Focus on understanding loop mechanics and dry-run execution  
- Will continue building more examples and algorithms
